	<!-- Nigeria Situation -->
	<section class="container-fluid" style="background-color: white;">
		<div class="container" style="background-color: white; padding: 20px;">
			<br>
			<p>Nigeria is a large country with an amazing population of over 200 million people who speak over 300 indigenous
				languages. Its a hot tourist destination in Africa. However, there is a minor flaw in all this beauty: POVERTY.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nigeria is one of the world's poorest countries and one of the worst places to live if you have big dreams. 86.9
				million Nigerians live in extreme poverty which represents roughly 50% of the country's population of 200
				million.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Nigeria faces a massive population boom, it will become the third-largest country in the world by 2050, and
				this problem is expected to worsen in the next 10 years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bitter truth is that your certificate alone cannot give you the life you want.
			</p>
			<p>
				Education now looks like a scam with the economic situation of the country. There are no or few available jobs
				in the oversaturated labour market.
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of unemployed Nigerians rose by <u>3.3 million to 20.9 million</u> in the third quarter of 2018, a
				report from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and there are proven statistics that it has risen even more ever since. Each academic year, universities and polytechnics admit close to 2 million students and produce about
				600,000 graduates.

				The days of graduating from a tertiary institution, landing a secure career, working for the companies for forty
				years, and retiring at 65 are rapidly gone. Something in the economy is shifting, which you may or may not be
				aware of. The old "job economy" is gradually fading, and a new economy is arising, which I refer to as the
				<span style="color: #B80C09; font-weight: bold;">"Skill Economy"</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				An economy where people are being paid more and more based on their skills, not their credentials, experience,
				or job position.
			</p>
			<p>
				The way things are going, more people will lose their jobs, and even most people that still have their jobs are
				not happy.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this digital age, <u>skills (high-income skills)</u> speak louder than <u>certificates</u> and since most
				people have
				certificates without a matching practical skill, unemployment is on the increase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Almost 65% of students in Nigeria can't afford a proper meal. It is no wonder that Soaked Garri and groundnut is
				the most consumed commodity on campus today.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being a student in Nigeria is frustrating enough but being a broke student is way worse.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a student, life can be challenging, particularly if you don't have a steady income or ain't born with a
				silver spoon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you're a student, it can be difficult to concentrate on your studies if your thoughts are constantly
				straying to topics such as how to get money or where to invest it.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for students like me, making money while going to school is a great way to improve your situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best thing about making money online is that you can combine it with your academics.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a broke student that used to depend solely on loans apps like Branch, Lcredit etc.

			</p>
			<p>
				Life has pushed me so hard to the wall, I had to figure out how to save myself and the people I care about from
				this financial insufficiency.
			</p>
			<p>
				After all, my life is 100% my responsibility, and no one – absolutely no one – was coming to save me.

			<p>
				Here was the turning point of my life!
			</p>
			<p>
				A few years ago, I can remember asking myself this question.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>"Marvelous, what exactly are you doing with your electronic devices?"</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				I felt useless because I had got a laptop for over three years without making a dime online.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, becoming a yahoo boy was not an option for me. It is not a legit way to make money on the internet as
				a student.
			</p>
			<p>
				The self-examination prompted me to research ways to make money online legally.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you think it is NOT possible for you to earn 5 to 6 figures per week legally online in Nigeria today. You've
				got it all wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				This I learned the hard way as I was quick to conclude that an online business doesn't have the potential to
				actualize my big dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				You are only struggling to make money because you haven't got the right connection and the right information.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center" style="color: #B80C09; font-family: Jost; font-weight: bolder;">
				I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!!!
			</h3>
			<p>
				The good news is that I've found a LEGIT and EASY way to make money in this same Nigeria.
			</p>
			<p>
				I discovered this highly profitable business model known as <span
					style="color: #B80C09; font-weight: bold;">"Affiliate Marketing"</span> in January, 2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started implementing it in March, 2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as of May 1 2022, I have made over 300k in pure profits.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #B80C09; font-family: Jost; font-weight: bolder;">That's just the beginning! WATCH-OUT!</p>
			<p>
				All because I stumbled on a free webinar that changed my life (stick around and I'll tell you how you can get
				this webinar).
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed '...information is PROFIT!' 💪
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center" style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold;">
				CONGRATULATIONS!
			</h3>
			<p>
				I am congratulating you because if you can see this, you are among the few lucky people that would get FREE
				ACCESS to the same webinar that has helped me to make over ₦300,000 in just 2 months.
			</p>
			<p>
				My aim currently is to teach a few people how to replicate my results in the shortest timeframe possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let us proceed. So what is <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold;">Affiliate Marketing</span>?
			</p>
			<p>
				I call it a <u>No-Fail business model</u>, a lucrative business of connecting a product owner/selling company to
				interested buyers and earning commissions for the simple work done. This is the same No-Fail Business Model that
				is being used by top companies like Jumia, Amazon, Clickbank, JvZoo, Commission Junction, WarriorPlus, Uber etc.
				This proven business model has been in existence since the 1980s.
			</p>
			<p>
				I currently work as an affiliate on Expertnaire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Expertnaire is an online digital marketplace for the sale of high-value digital products.
			</p>
			<p>
				I simply recommend useful products of my choice to people who need them, and I make my commission when sales are
				made, which means you don't have to own a product or buy one in order to sell it.

				The money you make is directly related to the sales you make. Simple as that
			</p>
			<p>
				The sales you make would depend on how helpful you are to the buyer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Marketing is a game of numbers, the more people you showed the product to, the more the chance of selling.

			<p>
				You might be wondering “How do I get customers to sell to",right? 😁

			<p>
				Relax, I gat you...👌

				Well, making money would be less difficult when you have the right information but I'm not saying that you are
				just gonna fold your hands and money will just jump into your bank account...😀
			</p>
			<p>
				It is worthy to note that if you do not put in the work, you won't get the result stated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please keep in mind that THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME.
			</p>
			<p>
				You need to put forth a significant amount of hard work and be consistent too!
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if you understand the process, you will profit from it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not trying to scare you but to prepare your mind for the profitable task ahead.

			<p>
				Now the question is, "How do I get started with <span style="color: #B80C09; font-weight: bold;">Affiliate

				Very Simple.
